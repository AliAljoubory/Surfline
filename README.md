# Surfline
Surfline is a take home project that uses Google's Places API to retrieve a list of places using a given location. It also includes the ability to determine a users current location or use a location specified from a map.

Once presented, it includes attributes related to that place that may be useful to the user including a place logo, name and opening hours.

Additional features include the ability to change your API Key, use of Dark Mode and Dynamic Type throughout the app and geo-targeting for determining a users current location.
